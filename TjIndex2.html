            <p>My name is Tj Coates. Before I started the Coding Bootcamp here at Rutgers, I am not going to lie I was very
                nervous and didn't know what to expect. I thought I was going to be completly out of it but since the program
                has started I am liking it a lot and I am looking forward to more things to come. I love the instructor and
                the TA's that help you with the process. Before I only completed just my first year of college and didn't
                know if I am going to survive this since I am only 18 I thought I needed more but I think with the help and
                drive I will be fine.</p>
